# Phase 1 Project
After months of working on completing Phase 1 of the Software Engineering program, it is now time to put everything I've learned in use. I've created a single page application that allows it's users to search for specific makeup products and giving these products a rating. Within each search users are able to view the brand, product, price, a rating and a product description. Users are also able to give the product of their choice a star rating between one and five. 

# Installation Instruction
first off, fork and clone the project to your local respitory then open index.html on the browser.
